  - `calculateDomainScore()` - weighted average of sub-criteria within domain
  - `calculateGlobalScore()` - sums weighted domain scores
  - `checkNoGoRules()` - validates DSCR, equity, guarantees, contracts, ESG
  - `identifyStrengthsAndWeaknesses()` - flags domains >8 or <4
  - `generateRecommendation()` - ✅/⚠️/❌/🔴 based on score and rules
  - `calculateEvaluation()` - orchestrates full pipeline

- **List:** `/app/evaluations/page.tsx`
  - Searchable table with filters (status, project)
  - Columns: project, type, analyst, score, rating, status, date
